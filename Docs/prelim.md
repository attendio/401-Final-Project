As a user:
    Login using mobile app
    See what events you've attended in the past

As an organizer:
    You can create an event, display qr code for users to scan
    You can see who came to your past events

Roster:
    Have an overview of who's in the org, who's been to what meetings, etc...

Organizations:
    ACM, for example
    user could see all members of the organization and get contact info

For our minimum viable product:
    Start with UT emails only. organizer can create event with qr code, and users can scan this qr code to check in.
    After a user checks in and the event is over, the organizer can view the attendance sheet from their event.
